by the way this is not completely from base, in geohot's he gets payloads from  nodes which fetch block information. im probably not going to do this because I value my sanity, instead il use an api or something. most of this code was stolen from geohot by the way, i do understand whats happening though (doesn't this sound like a programmer in denial lmao xd)
